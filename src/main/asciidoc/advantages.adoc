== When to use Flutter / Advantages

This chapter is about the advantages of Flutter and when to use it.

=== Cross-Platform

The main advantage is that you develop for multiple operating systems at the same time.
It is only necessary to maintain one code base which leads to high productivity and resource savings.

=== Great performance

Dart compiles the files into native code and this runs super fast on the respective operating systems.
Fast startup times and butter smooth performance is always welcomed.

=== Open-source

The community behind Flutter is growing in a rapid pace. Everyone can contribute and help to make it
even more awesome.

=== Fast development

One of the best features is "Hot Reload". Edited source code gets automatically injected into the running
`Dart Virtual Machine`. The changes are getting updated in real time and a restart is not required.
This allows fast and quick development.
