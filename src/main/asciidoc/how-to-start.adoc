== Starting point

=== Widgets

In Flutter every component is a so called `Widget`. Every UI element is a widget
and multiple widgets are combined to create more complex structures / widgets.
Everything is a widget! There are two kinds of widgets: `stateful` & `stateless`

=== Stateful vs Stateless

The difference is that when the state in a `stateful widget` changes, the UI also
updates and displays the change. Best practise is to only use stateful widgets when state
is needed. Keep stateless widgets simple and dumb.

=== Installation

Just follow this awesome installation guide from the official website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

=== IDE

There are three editors which are supported by Flutter by plugins. It is highly recommended
to use these: `IntelliJ`,  `Android Studio`  or  `Visual Studio Code`. Awesome guide: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode
