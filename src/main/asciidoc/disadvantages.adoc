== Limitations / Disadvantages

=== 3rd party libraries

There aren't many 3rd party libraries out there yet because the framework is relatively new.
However, the big community is constantly creating new awesome libraries

=== Error Logs

If an error occurs, then it is not always easy to understand what failed. However, the Flutter
team improved the error message structure (in Flutter version 1.9), which helps a little.
